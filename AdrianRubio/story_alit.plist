		<string>At age 13, my father gave me an iPod Touch, I could say that&apos;s where all started, but my fascination for technology comes from way before that.

Surfing the web, I found out people &quot;hacked&quot; their iPhones/iPods to get all kinds of goodies. It was a whole community.

So I couln&apos;t resist.</string>

		<string>They made all kind of things: apps, tweaks, themes... I wanted to be part of it.
    
But I didn&apos;t know a thing about making apps.

So I learned how to use Photoshop by myself and I made a few themes.

Until I made a theme called &quot;Alit&quot;, which was really popular.</string>

I wanted to learn how to program something.</string>
